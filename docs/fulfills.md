# fulfills 
**The fulfills command is still preliminary!** 
```
knemm fulfills  [options] <candidate> <target>
```
The command checks if one state (or claim) - the **candidate** - fulfills another one - the
**target**. If it does so, no output is printed. If it does not fulfill it, the diff required
to go from **candidate** to **target** is echoed back. 

More docs available on [the diff command](diff.md).


## Options

The options are mostly the same as for the [join command](join.md).
